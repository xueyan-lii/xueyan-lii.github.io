I'm currently a first year PhD student in the [CLS](https://learning-systems.org/) programme, which is under the Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems, a joint PhD programme between ETH Zurich and the Max Planck Institute (MPI). I'm currently staying at MPI - Intelligent Systems in TÃ¼bingen, Germany. I will move to ETH Zurich in 2026 where I will evetually obtain my PhD degree in 2028. My main supervisor is [Dr Jonas Geiping](https://jonasgeiping.github.io/) (MPI) and my second supervisor is [Prof Mrinmaya Sachan](https://lre.inf.ethz.ch/). 

Previously, I obtained a MPhil degree from University of Cambridge studying Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence. My focus was on natual language processing. My dissertation was on multimodal retrieval augmented visual question answering, supervised by [Prof Bill Byrne](https://sites.google.com/view/bill-byrne/home?pli=1). I also have an integrated MEng degree from Imperial College London in Bioengineering.

Between my studies, I interned at Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, and Oxehealth for software engineering and research roles.

My current research interest is centered around LLM uncertainty, how to use it to control decoding, and the seemingly impossible task of balancing diversity vs accuracy trade-off in reasoning tasks. Recently I've been working on uncertainty-aware samplers and token-level calibration. I am also interested in multi-modal integration and their robustness to OOD shifts. I hope my work will lead to more interpretable and trustworthy systems by understanding their failure modes.

Quantitative research aside, I like to think about what AGI means and what people expect AGI to be capable of. There seems to be a unsatiable need for LLMs to be mind readers. How's that fair? How can we best adapt our skills to thrive in a post AGI world (assuming AGI will happen in our lifetime)? My hot take: taste and smell are modalities that AI have not touched. Food is still uniquely human, personal and irreplacable. Being a personal chef is my backup plan in case AI replaces most coding and research jobs. I'm currently obsessed with Chinese cuisine and slow cooking.
