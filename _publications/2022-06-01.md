excerpt: 'MEng thesis supervised by Dr Lance Rane at Imperial College London. I proposed a novel approach based on output embedding mapping to encode the cyclical nature of a gait cycle. Used knowledge distillation, weight pruning and quantization to compress CNN to have minimal latency and optimal performance on wearable hardware with limited memory. Focused on the generalizability of gait classification on pathological gait data collected in house.'

Wearable devices and active prostheses that deliver therapy or modulate gait characteristics in coordination with the gait cycle must be capable of identification and classification of gait events in real time. Artificial neural networks that achieve good accuracy have been successfully employed for gait classification. However, there is a lack of studies on the generalizability of gait classification algorithms to different subjects, especially those with pathological gait. At the same time, due to high computational cost and complexity, many of these models are not suitable for use on low powered devices for real time gait analysis. This paper describes the development of a lightweight convolutional neural network that can be deployed to portable hardware for accurate gait phase classification in patients with osteoarthritis. To achieve high performance and efficiency, a novel approach based on output embedding mapping is used to encode an inductive prior about the physical nature of the gait cycle, enabling improved generalisation performance on pathological gait at the cost of a few additional parameters. A lightweight 15KB model achieves 84.9% and 67.0% accuracy classifying 8 gait phases for healthy and patients with osteoarthritis with 2.76ms inference latency.
